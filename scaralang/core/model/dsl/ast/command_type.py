    '''
        Enumeration of supported SCARA Domain-Specific Language (DSL) command types.

        It defines:

            :attributes:
                | CONFIG - System configuration command keyword.
                | CONFIG_ELBOW - Kinematic elbow arm configuration (LEFT or RIGHT).
                | CONFIG_MOTOR - Stepper motor actuation drive mode (OPEN_LOOP or CLOSED_LOOP).
                | SPEED - Feedrate speed setting (RAPID or WORK).
                | ACCEL - Path acceleration setting.
                | OVERRIDE - Real-time global speed override percentage.
                | HOME - Multi-axis homing sequence.
                | MOVE_J - Fast point-to-point joint move.
                | MOVE_L - Linear Cartesian interpolated motion.
                | JUMP - 3D parabolic arch pick-and-place motion.
                | ARC_CW - Circular arc clockwise.
                | ARC_CCW - Circular arc counter-clockwise.
                | SPLINE - Smooth spline / Bézier curve interpolation.
                | APPROACH - Relative vertical approach along Z.
                | RETRACT - Relative vertical retract along Z.
                | JOG_AXIS - Relative manual jog along Cartesian axis.
                | JOG_JOINT - Relative manual rotation of joint.
                | ZONE - Corner path blending mode (FINE or BLEND).
                | TOOL_ORIENT - End-effector 4th axis orientation mode.
                | FRAME_SET - Definition of local work coordinate frame.
                | FRAME_RESET - Reset coordinates to base world frame.
                | PALLET_DEF - Matrix pallet definition.
                | MOVE_PALLET - Move to index in defined pallet.
                | PROBE - Tactile contact search until trigger.
                | TOOL - End-effector vertical actuation (UP or DOWN).
                | PUMP - Vacuum pump actuation (ON or OFF).
                | VALVE - Release valve actuation (ON or OFF).
                | WAIT - Dwell delay pause execution.
                | WAIT_MS - Time delay in milliseconds.
                | SYNC - Wait for motion queue buffer to complete.
                | HOLD - Feed hold / pause trajectory.
                | RESUME - Resume paused trajectory.
                | ESTOP - Immediate emergency stop.
                | ENABLE - Energize robot stepper driver stages.
                | DISABLE - De-energize robot stepper driver stages.
