        Mutable state carrier tracking machine state throughout DSL AST static analysis.

        It defines:

            :attributes:
                | is_homed - Boolean indicating if a calibration/home command was executed.
                | motion_occurred - Boolean indicating if any motion instruction was encountered.
                | pump_on - Boolean indicating active vacuum pump state.
                | valve_on - Boolean indicating active blow-off valve state.
                | zone_mode - Active zone blending mode (FINE or BLEND).
                | zone_radius - Active zone blend radius in millimeters.
                | last_coords - Coordinate tuple of prior linear move or empty tuple.
                | motor_drive_mode - Active motor actuation mode (OPEN_LOOP or CLOSED_LOOP).
