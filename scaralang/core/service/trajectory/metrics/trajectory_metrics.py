class TrajectoryMetrics:
    '''
        Computes motion distance, planar radial offsets, and duration metrics for trajectory plans.

        It defines:

            :methods:
                | distance_between - Computes 3D Euclidean distance between two waypoints.
                | radial_distance - Calculates planar radial distance from robot base.
                | calculate_distance - Computes total 3D Cartesian distance along the path.
                | calculate_duration - Computes estimated execution duration based on speeds.
